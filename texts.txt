        I have six years of work experience as an electrician and as a
        supervisor in that field of work.
        Though this experience description is not directly related to the new
        profession I am studying, it has taught me valuable things about
        working life. I have learned how to resist pressure, how to make
        difficult decisions, communicating despite language barriers and
        teamwork in demanding conditions.
        The world of information technology has only opened up to me when I
        started my studies in HAMK University of Applied Sciences,
        but hunger has increased while eating, so to speak. I have gotten good
        grades, I am genuinely interested about the subjects we are taught and
        I am active teamplayer in group work, no matter what my role is.

Introduction.
      I am a 26 year old student from HAMK University of Applied Sciences. I
      am studying for a Bachelor of Business Administration for the first
      year, my field of study is computer science and telecommunications.
      I used to work as a electrician in permanent employment for six years.
      During my employment, I worked for the most part, as a site leader or
      as the oldest member of the working group.
      I am known for being passionate for my approach to my work and I
      always give my best for every project. I am also known for thinking
      through all the variables as best I can which should be taken
      into account at different stages of the project. My goal is always to
      complete tasks efficiently and, in case of mistakes, learn from them.
      I am a well-liked colleague at work and in my free time, and in my
      opinion, a good working atmosphere and easily approachable colleagues
      are part of success.
      My goal is to become a full-stack software developer and maybe
      someday work for the Finnish Defence Forces in this field of
      expertise.
