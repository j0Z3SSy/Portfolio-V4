      <h3 class="dark-heading">Roots.</h3>
      <p class="dark-text"> 
        I was born and raised in Finland. 
        To be exact, I spent my entire youth on the eastern side of Helsinki, 
        where I made many friends, learned the basics of life and finally met my future wife. 
        When I started my studies at HAMK University of Applied Sciences, 
        I moved to Hämeenlinna.

      <p class="light-text"> 
        I studied to become an electrician and baccalaureate
        in 2016 at the same time. 
        I deepened my electrician studies in 2019 
        during the coronavirus pandemic. 
        Finally, in 2023, I thought, 
        "What would I REALLY like to do for a living?" 
        After studying for a year at HAMK University of Applied Sciences, 
        I think I have found the answer to this question.

      <h3 class="dark-heading">Career.</h3>
      <p class="dark-text"> 
        My career as an electrician began in 2016 
        after graduation and continued for 6 consecutive years, 
        excluding my military service. I showed excellent initiative, 
        robust professionalism and a sense of responsibility. 
        I quickly progressed to the role of site manager and formed 
        a deep trust between the employer and the customers. 
        When I decided to change professions, 
        I had a good understanding of everything and much of it in practice.

      <p class="trans-text"> 
        In fact, I didn't quit being an electrician. 
        Alongside my studies, 
        I started to obtain work permits that would allow me to work as 
        a light entrepreneur alongside my future career. 
        This way I can make the most of my years of experience.

      <p class="light-text"> 
        Pretty easy question! My family, of course. 
        It includes my wife Aino and our dogs Uuno and Nasse. 
        Of course, part of my motivation is my desire to advance 
        in my career and my interest in the industry.

      <p class="dark-text"> 
        My goal, within 5 years is to be a strong expert in software development. 
        At the end of the day, senior full-stack software developer 
        is a title I'm going to work hard for and achieve. There is no question of that.
