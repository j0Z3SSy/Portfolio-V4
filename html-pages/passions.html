      I am a 26 year old student from HAMK University of Applied Sciences. I
      am studying for a Bachelor of Business Administration for the first
      year, my field of study is computer science and telecommunications.
      I used to work as a electrician in permanent employment for six years.
      During my employment, I worked for the most part, as a site leader or
      as the oldest member of the working group.
      I am known for being passionate for my approach to my work and I
      always give my best for every project. I am also known for thinking
      through all the variables as best I can which should be taken
      into account at different stages of the project. My goal is always to
      complete tasks efficiently and, in case of mistakes, learn from them.
      I am a well-liked colleague at work and in my free time, and in my
      opinion, a good working atmosphere and easily approachable colleagues
      are part of success.
      My goal is to become a full-stack software developer and maybe
      someday work for the Finnish Defence Forces in this field of
      expertise.
